# SayMySubtitles

SayMySubtitles is a macOS application that adds timed audio to your videos based on a `.srt` subtitle file. This is particularly useful for creators who have American Sign Language (ASL) videos and want to make them accessible to a wider audience by adding a spoken audio track that matches the subtitles.

## About The Project

This project was created to bridge the accessibility gap for videos that primarily use sign language. By taking an existing `.srt` subtitle file, the application generates and syncs audio to the video, making it more accessible to those who are visually impaired or prefer audio narration.

## Features

*   **Text-to-Speech:** Converts subtitle text into spoken audio.
*   **Audio Syncing:** Automatically times the generated audio to match the subtitle timestamps.
*   **Video Integration:** Merges the generated audio track with your existing video file.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple app for macOS users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A Silicon Mac (M1,M2,M3,M4) running a recent version of macOS, Tahoe or Sequoia.

## ðŸ§© Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Download** the latest version of `SayMySubtitles.dmg`.

2. **Open** the DMG file â€” youâ€™ll see a **SayMySubtitles** folder and an **Applications** shortcut.

3. **Drag the `SayMySubtitles` folder** to your **Applications** folder.  
   This folder contains:
   - `SayMySubtitles.app`
   - the `bin/` and `video/` directories
   - and a helper script `1-Allow-Run.command`

4. **Run the `1-Allow-Run.command` script** once after copying.  
   It removes macOSâ€™s quarantine flags and ensures the app and `ffmpeg` binary are executable.  
   - Double-click it, or  
   - Right-click â†’ **Open** â†’ **Open** if macOS shows a warning.

5. After that, **right-click `SayMySubtitles.app` â†’ Open** (the first time only) and confirm if prompted in  
   **System Settings â–¸ Privacy & Security â–¸ Open Anyway**.  
   This is required because the app is not Apple-signed.

### Usage

1. **Open** the `SayMySubtitles` app.

2. **Drag and drop** your video file (`.mp4`, `.mov`, etc.) and your subtitle file (`.srt`) into the window.

3. Choose a **voice** from the dropdown menu.

4. Click **Replace Audio**.  
   The app will generate a timed spoken narration of each subtitle line and automatically replace the
   videoâ€™s audio track with that narration.

5. When finished, a new video file will be saved next to your original, named:

   ```text
   <original_name>_tts_audio.mp4
   ```
### Notes
	â€¢	The app works entirely offline â€” all processing is done locally using macOSâ€™s built-in text-to-speech
and a bundled ffmpeg binary.
	â€¢	Your original video and subtitle files are never modified.
