# SayMySubtitles

SayMySubtitles is a macOS application that adds timed audio to your videos based on a `.srt` subtitle file. This is particularly useful for creators who have American Sign Language (ASL) videos and want to make them accessible to a wider audience by adding a spoken audio track that matches the subtitles.

## About The Project

This project was created to bridge the accessibility gap for videos that primarily use sign language. By taking an existing `.srt` subtitle file, the application generates and syncs audio to the video, making it more accessible to those who are visually impaired or prefer audio narration.

## Features

*   **Text-to-Speech:** Converts subtitle text into spoken audio.
*   **Audio Syncing:** Automatically times the generated audio to match the subtitle timestamps.
*   **Video Integration:** Merges the generated audio track with your existing video file.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple app for macOS users.

## Getting Started
